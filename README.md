**Mobile-Phone Swarm-Motion Detection, Mass-Data-Analysis and Visualization**



WTF?

Imagine you have some kind of Motion-Data. The motion from Mobile-Phone-Devices over an geographic Aera.

We would need hundrets or thousends of such kind of ESP8266-Mobile-Device-Scanners to cover a big Town ( like Munich ) .

Finally we took the Data from some of our scans..and generated the rest of this kind of data. This way the data we observe here **is a simulation** ...some kind of **fake-Data**. So we take this data as given!

But bear in Mind - the technology behind all this is REAL! The basic Concept on how to Measure such kind of Device-Location is described here: https://github.com/iCounterBOX/Trilateration-with-NodeMCU-8266


**The Experiment**

Our assumption is to have hundrets of those Scan-Boxes over an area..e.g Munich:
