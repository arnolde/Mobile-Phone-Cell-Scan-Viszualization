**Mobile-Phone Swarm-Motion Detection, Mass-Data-Analysis and Visualization**



WTF?

Imagine you have some kind of Motion-Data. The motion from Mobile-Phone-Devices over an geographic Aera.

We would need hundrets or thousends of such kind of ESP8266-Mobile-Device-Scanners to cover a big Town ( like Munich ) .

Finally we took the Data from some of our scans..and generated the rest of this kind of data. This way the data we observe here **is a simulation** ...some kind of **fake-Data**. So we take this data as given!

But bear in Mind - the technology behind all this is REAL!
